          <p>I am writing this on 19 July, yk the day after your wifi recharge got over.
            Well, I keep updating the first 2 pages you saw before bcs yk I'm very picky right.
            I wanted everything to look perfect. I have spent a lot of my time and brain building this
            birthday website for you bcs I love you, so don't you dare to say that I changed :(</p>
        
        <p>I spent a day to collect suitable backgrounds for the pages. 
          I made a new github acc with a new repository just so that you could access this website
          online anywhere in the world. I spent 10 days coding the basic structure and making
          it responsive both on pcs and mobile phones. If you remember, I told you how I was unable
          to upload a bigger file one day. It wasn't for my dad's project but for this website. The 1st page 
          had a bigger mb bg so I had to use 100% of my brain to upload it in the github repository bcs the limit was less.
          Then I spent 2 more days in finding cute stickers which will match my theme. Fortunately I got some 
          really cutie gifs which you see on this page. Oh funfact, I'm not a computer science student btw. In case anyone who sees this wonders. </p>

        <h3 class="letter2">This is my Boyfriend :3</h3>
        
        <p class="end-para">So this is my boyfriend. He calls himself 'Superman'. His twitter is named superman
          and even his wifi is named superman. Indeed he is my superman but for some personal reasons
          he is also my SPIDERMAN. Maybe that's more cuter because then I could be his Gwen Stacy.
          He is the 'Peter Parker' to my 'Gwen Stacy' anddddd 'Andrew Garfield' to my 'Emma Stone'.
